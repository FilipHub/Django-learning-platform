# Django learning platform mockup project
This is a Project for a subject at Faculty of Computer Science and Engineering using Django and Python. The purpose of this project was to create a simple mockup for a learning platform. 
This learning platform would concentrate on teaching people how to better use their Windows/MacOs devices. 
Currently this project has an Admin pannel, capability for Login and Register for the users and the design of the rest of the imagined capabilities (forum, lectures).
